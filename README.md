## stm32 bare metal programming journey
Learning Bare Metal Programming with stm32 nucleo-64 board

In this repository, I document my journey of learning bare metal programming on stm32 nucleo board. 

## 0_led_toggle_addr
In the first project which I named 0_led_toggle_addr, I created addresses and created registers from the addresses for the NUCLEO-GOB1RE micro-controller by means of  utilizing the reference manual (RM0444), Datasheet (STM32G0B1xB/xC/xE), user manual (UM2324) and schematic diagram of the NUCLEO-GOB1RE board. I was able to address the GPIOA port and toggle the LED_PIN_5.
